And the way it pairs with pepperoni is perfection. Oregano is often a key flavor in pizza so why not let it shine bright?\n\nHere’s another thing you may think I’m crazy for saying, I like turkey pepperoni just as much, if not more than, regular pepperoni (my husband even thinks the same thing).\n\nIt has all the same flavors just a lot less fat, so you don’t end up with a pizza swimming in a layer of grease from an overdose of pepperoni fat.\n\nDon’t get this pizza wrong, it’s definitely no low cal pizza, it’s just tweaked to suit my personal taste. If you like regular pepperoni too much to ever even dare reach for something else, by all means go ahead and use that.\n\nI’m not here to change your taste in food or tell you only my way is the right way, I just share my opinion (and I’m very opinionated when it comes to food, but aren’t we all?). Turkey bacon on the other hand, don’t go there."}]}]}},"context":{"slug":"pepperoni-pizza"}}
